# My React Starter Config

This is just my personal preference on setting up React project. Well, mostly from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) though. But it helps for setting up repetitive tasks on configuration.
### Installation

The requirements will be the same as [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dikadj/project-init.git
$ cd project-init/
$ yarn install
```

And get it done... pretty basic (._.)>
